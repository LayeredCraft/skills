## Logical operators

- `AND` all conditions must be true
- `BETWEEN` inclusive range check
- `IN` membership check in a list of values
- `IS` type/null/missing style checks
- `NOT` negates a condition
- `OR` at least one condition must be true

## Limitations

- Only operators listed in DynamoDB PartiQL docs are supported.
- `IN` has documented limits: up to 50 partition-key values (AWS docs use "hash attribute") or up to 100 non-key attribute values.
- `IN` results are paged (up to 10 items per page) and may require `NextToken` retrieval.
